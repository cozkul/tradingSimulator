## Introduction

The SP500 Timing Simulator is a robust Java desktop application designed to empower users in simulating timing their financial investments with ease. In an ever-evolving financial landscape, having a tool that provides education and an opportunity to try timing the market without real life consequences is invaluable.

I started this project because I want to convince others and myself that if stock prices are a random walk, it is hard to beat the average consistently.
