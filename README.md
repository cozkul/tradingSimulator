# ETF Timing Simulator

## Introduction

The ETF Timing Simulator is a robust Java desktop application designed to empower users in simulating timing their financial investments with ease. In an ever-evolving financial landscape, having a tool that provides education and an opportunity to try timing the market without real life consequences is invaluable.
